# Java_Learning_Kit
## java 1 textbook from community college of Philadelphia.

This was originally shared as free with me, and im just returning the favor. 
This is a valuable resource for beginners who would like to learn
the basics of computer programing.

The projects in the text book and the assignments were built using java and the netbeans ide.

download netbeans here to open project files:
https://netbeans.org/

I have included all of the assignments, with my solutions from that semester. 
Information should be free.
