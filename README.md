## java 1 textbook from community college of Philadelphia. written by Chuck Herbert 

This was originally shared as free. 
I am sharing this because I believe it is a valuable resource for beginners who would like to learn
the basics of computer programing.

I have included all of the assignments, with my solutions from that semester. 
Information should be free.
