# Java_Learning_Kit
## java 1 textbook from community college of Philadelphia. written by Chuck Herbert 

This was originally shared as free with me, and im just returning the favor. 
This is a valuable resource for beginners who would like to learn
the basics of computer programing.

I have included all of the assignments, with my solutions from that semester. 
Information should be free.
